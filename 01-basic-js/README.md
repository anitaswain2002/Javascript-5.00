-javascript is a high level programming language for build web pages.
-now we used the ES6(echma script 6)version of javascript ,in other words we called vanila javascript.

variable:-

-variable is a container to stores some data.
-in javascript we have3 types of variables.
a.let
b.var
c.const

let:-
-let is a type of variable which is used for changing thevariable name later.
-now these days,most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
-let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.

b.var:-
    -var is a type of variable which is also used for changingthe variable laterstage.
    var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the time.

c.const:-
    -const is a type ofvariable where  we can't change our data further.
    -const means constant to store some data like numbers,integers etc..

    task:-
     1.difference between let and var.
     2.difference between var and const.
     3.what do you mean by haisting.(when we don't declare valueof variable but it execute the code )
